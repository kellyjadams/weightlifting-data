# Weightlifting Data
## Overview
An ongoing project tracking and analyzing my weightlifting data using SQL. 

I'll be tracking/analyzing 5 main barbell lifts: 
1. deadlift, 
2. squat, 
3. overhead press,
4. bench press, and
5. row. 

The first set of data will be from the months June 2022 - August 2022.
